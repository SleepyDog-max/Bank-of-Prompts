                <li>What makes this revision more appropriate for the target audience? How does it better reflect the textual norms?</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>In the original translation, what errors did I miss during my revision? Are there any remaining distortions, omissions, or additions that affect the meaning?</li>

                <li>How effective was my revision in improving the accuracy and fluency of the translation? Are there areas where I could have made further improvements?</li>
                <li>Why did you categorize this as an error? Can you explain how it affects the translationâ€™s accuracy or readability?</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Can you help me understand why this particular error falls into the category of [specific category, e.g., unjustified omission]?</li>
                <li>What makes this categorization accurate? How does it align with the assessment criteria in the rubric?</li>
